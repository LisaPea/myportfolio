<h1>Lisa's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Hidden Figures</h3>

<p>Hidden Figures is a favorite because it displayed perseverance and wisdom during adversity.  These ladies worked very hard to overcome negative stereotypes and oppression.  In the end, they prevailed, although much work was still left to do.</p>

<h3>Queen of Katwe</h3>

<p>I enjoyed Queen of Katwe.  It was a well-developed portrayal of a young girl growing up in the slums with no way to better herself and no way out.  Through the outpouring and sacrifice of a missionary, she was transformed into a skillful and successful competitor, even to the point of pulling her family out of poverty.</p>

<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>

<p>Who doesn't love Princess Bride? This is a quirky, imaginative story of a young lady on a farm and the young servant man who works there falling in love. In order to support them in a new life of their own, he must leave to seek his fortune.  He is captured by pirates, and she is kidnapped by the neighboring ruler's thugs.  The movie is full of crazy and less than believable adventure as they are reunited and attempt to escape from their captors.</p>
